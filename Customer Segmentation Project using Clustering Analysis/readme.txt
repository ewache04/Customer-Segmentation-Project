# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project explores customer segmentation using clustering techniques, specifically K-means clustering, on a dataset containing information about customers. The dataset includes features such as age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters based on their characteristics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Exploration:
   - The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and initial exploratory data analysis is performed.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Missing values are handled, and the dataset is prepared for clustering.

3. K-means Clustering:
   - Implementation of K-means clustering on features like "Annual Income (k$)" and "Spending Score (1-100)."
   - Checking and verification steps ensure successful clustering.

4. Agglomerative Clustering:
   - Implementation of Agglomerative Clustering with different linkages.
   - Silhouette scores are computed for performance evaluation.

5. Performance Evaluation:
   - Comparison of silhouette scores between K-means and Agglomerative Clustering.

6. Results:
   - Display of clustered data and key insights.

7. Data Display:
   - The DataFrame head and tail are displayed for easy exploration.

## Descriptive Statistics

- Descriptive statistics for the dataset include count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum for relevant features.

## K-means Clustering Results

- K-means clustering is successful with a silhouette score of 0.5539 for K=5.
- The DataFrame displays the clustered data with a new "Cluster" column.

## Agglomerative Clustering Results

- Agglomerative Clustering is implemented with different linkages (single, complete, average).
- Silhouette scores are computed and compared.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
